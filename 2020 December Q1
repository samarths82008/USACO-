# Farmer John's cows have been holding a daily online gathering on the "mooZ" video meeting platform.
# For fun, they have invented a simple number game to play during the meeting to keep themselves entertained.
# Elsie has three positive integers A, B, and C(A≤B≤C). 
# These integers are supposed to be secret, so she will not directly reveal them to her sister Bessie.
# Instead, she gives Bessie seven (not necessarily distinct) integers in the range 1…109
# claiming that they are A, B, C, A+B, B+C, C+A, and A+B+C in some order.
